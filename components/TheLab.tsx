          <strong>In the Lab</strong>: TAs should foster a supportive atmosphere
          where students feel comfortable asking questions and engaging with the
          material. The importance of preparation, clear communication, active
          listening, and providing constructive feedback are crucial to your
          effectiveness in the lab. TAs are encouraged to circulate the room,
          monitor student progress, and facilitate group discussions (when
          appropriate) to enhance collaborative learning.

          You may be leading a teaching team of TAs and Demonstrators. We do
          encourage you to be collegial with one another and develop positive
          relationships, but the purpose of lab and tutorial times are to focus
          on the learning. Be mindful that students will be reticent to approach
          you for help if you and others leading the sessions are deep in
          conversation! Always be present, welcoming and observant.

          Creating a Sense of Belonging for Students
        </h3>

        <p className="mt-2">
          It's important that students feel a sense of belonging. You need to
          facilitate this!
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>
            Start by sharing your name and the names of any Demonstrators in the
            room. Share something about yourself with your students. Perhaps
            your course of study, where you are from, your favourite hobby, etc.
            Even something about your own journey as a CS student. This helps
            students get to know you and develops a sense of familiarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remind your students that, as a TA, your role is to support their
            learning, which means approaching interactions differently than you
            would as a peer.
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to make an effort to learn students' names. A good way of
            doing this is to have students write their names on labels and wear
            them on their lapel the first couple of classes or create name tents
            (folding a piece of paper in half, students write their names on one
            half, then prop up the paper next to them). Also, encourage students
            to share their names with other students when they engage with each
            other for paired or group work.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student asks a clarifying question after a demonstration or if
            it is relevant for the whole class, repeat it for everyone in the
            class to hear before you respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use students' names when speaking to them. If you do not know it,
            ask them and then repeat it before you respond. "Great question,
            Ammarâ€¦.."

                When Teaching Assistants (TAs) in Computer Science are
                responsible for lab classes, there are several important
                considerations to keep in mind to ensure a smooth and productive
                learning environment. Here's a breakdown of the key areas to
                focus on:
              </p>

              <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4">1. Technical Preparedness</h4>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Software and Hardware Setup:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Make sure that all required software is installed, configured,
                  and updated before the lab session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verify that hardware components are functioning properly if
                  you need them (this includes audio/visual equipment).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Backup and Recovery Plans:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Prepare contingency plans in case of technical failures (e.g.,
                  server crashes or corrupted files). Also, if students
                  experience issues with their laptops, one can be borrowed from
                  the CS Help Desk on the first floor of the Goldberg. Student
                  ID is required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep backup copies of essential software and data and know how
                  to restore the environment quickly.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Lab Environment Consistency:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Ensure that all students receive the same information
                  regarding what it is they need to access/download either
                  before or at the beginning of the lab to avoid confusion.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4">
                2. Clear Instructions and Demonstrations
              </h4>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Start each session with a brief overview of the objectives and
                  tasks for the day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clearly explain the expected outcomes and deliverables
                  (introduce any rubrics and exemplars at this time if you have
                  them).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Demonstrations:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Demonstrate essential skills or concepts and specific
                  programming functions, especially those that students may
                  struggle with, such as debugging techniques.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use visual aids, code snippets, and live coding to make
                  explanations clear and engaging.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Written Guidelines:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  Provide step-by-step instructions or handouts that students
                  can refer to during the lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make sure these documents are available digitally through the
                  learning management system (LMS). This helps with
                  accessibility as students can enlarge the text or use screen
                  readers.

                3. Supporting Student Learning
              </h4>

              <p className="font-medium mt-2">Encourage Problem-Solving:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

                  After any demonstrations have been given,{" "}
                  <strong>guide</strong> students through problem-solving
                  processes rather than giving direct answers. This means that
                  you will be asking "Guiding Questions" and pointing to where
                  you may see the problem.
                </li>
                <li>

                  to put their hands up. Just because the room or a particular
                  student is quiet, doesnâ€™t mean that they arenâ€™t struggling
                  with implementing a concept. If you notice a student isnâ€™t
                  progressing in their work, stop and ask them questions. Be
                  supportive and kind in your approach.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use open-ended questions to prompt students to explain their
                  thought processes. If you notice that students are reluctant
                  to respond, pair them up to discuss a response first, then
                  give feedback to you with an answer or give a means to respond
