                Is the teaching space physically accessible? Ensure that those who are (dis)Abled can access the classroom. Keep a few seats at the front for individuals who may be using wheelchairs or crutches. There could be other students who cannot manage stairs well, ensuring physical accessibility is important.

                Inclusion also means supporting the emotional and mental well-being of students. University life can be overwhelmingâ€”especially for international students, first-generation learners, or students dealing with trauma, discrimination, or financial stress.
              </p>

                <li>Remind students that it's okay to ask for help, and that Dalhousie has confidential and free supports.</li>
                <li>Be flexible with deadlines where reasonableâ€”rigidity can disproportionately harm those with mental health challenges or caregiving responsibilities.</li>

                As a TA or Instructor, you hold power in the classroomâ€”often more than you realize. Being mindful of that power means avoiding public call-outs, being transparent about grading, and using inclusive language and tone. Also, be aware of your body language and non-verbal cues when addressing students.

                Inclusivity thrives in classrooms where students feel seen. Consider using small group discussions, weekly check-ins, and anonymous suggestion forms to build trust and inclusivity.

                  <strong>Fostering a Positive Learning Environment:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Start by creating an engaging atmosphere to capture the attention of students and help them focus on the lecture.</li>
                    <li>Foster an environment that encourages learning by reducing distractions and noise in the classroom.</li>
                    <li>Bring enthusiasm and energy into the classroom. Teaching is a sacred duty, and as a TA, you should take pride in facilitating the learning process.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Be aware of cultural differences in the classroom. Students may come from diverse backgrounds, with different values, assumptions, and learning experiences.</li>
                    <li>Non-verbal communication and manners vary across cultures. Some behaviors may be perceived as rude in one culture but are acceptable in another.</li>
                    <li>Do not personalize student behavior that may seem casual or informal.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <strong>Overcoming Language Barriers:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>International students may face challenges with verbal communication. If you're an international TA, make every effort to improve your English and practice speaking clearly and slowly.</li>
                    <li>We are part of a global community, and as such, we will be listening to many different accents â€“ that is a good thing! It means members of our community can communicate in more than one language. We encourage you to focus on delivering the material confidently.</li>
                    <li>Encourage students to raise questions if they don't understand. Repeat questions asked by students to ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>

                  <strong>Presentation and Preparedness:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Practice your lectures out loud. Watch yourself in the mirror to improve verbal communication and eliminate distracting mannerisms.</li>
                    <li>Exaggerate your speech if necessary, especially if English is not your first language, and try to speak with a clear accent.</li>
                    <li>Repeat key points and emphasize important concepts using gestures and tone variations to engage students effectively.</li>

                  <strong>Classroom Management:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Set clear rules at the beginning of the class, including expectations regarding behaviour, use of electronics, and participation.</li>
                    <li>You have the authority to stop disruptive behaviour. Address it politely but firmly to ensure the learning process is not affected.</li>

                This video explores the preconceived notions held by a computer science teaching assistant (TA) before beginning her role. It highlights key insights she gained through her experience:
              </p>
              
              <p className="mt-3">
                <strong>Collaboration matters:</strong> Contrary to common assumptions, students enjoy communicating and working together to solve problems. It's important to design learning activities that foster collaboration and peer learning.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Context is key:</strong> To help students grasp abstract concepts, it is essential to provide contextualized examples and problem exemplars. This supports students in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Feedback must be constructive:</strong> The video emphasizes the harm caused by a lack of meaningful feedback. Appropriate feedback helps students identify their mistakes, understand why they went wrong, and learn how to improve. It's a critical component of the learning process.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Students need to learn how to learn:</strong> A widespread issue in many computer science programs is that students lack metacognitive strategies. The TA talks about this issue in the study body that she works with: students' lack of effective study techniques which are required for academic success. In education terms, this is called "Learning to learn", it is the ability to understand, manage, and improve your learning processes.
