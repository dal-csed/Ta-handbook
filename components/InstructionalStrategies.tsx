          As you develop your expertise in various teaching and learning
          settings, you must develop your "Toolbox of Instructional Strategies"
          to be an effective educator. Below, are some instructional strategies
          that can be implemented to help organize the learning environment,
          assist your students with knowledge and skill acquisition and keep you
          organized in your approach! As always, you need to be intentional and
          choose strategies that will work for your specific context.

          In today's diverse classrooms, labs and tutorials, educators employ
          various instructional strategies to meet the unique needs of their
          students. Among these, (Explicit) Direct Instruction, Guided Practice,
          and Differentiation are pivotal in enhancing student comprehension and
          engagement whilst challenging them with learning activities and course
          outcome-related tasks. Universal Design for Learning must be
          intentionally woven into the fabric of engagement of students,
          representation of information and action and expression of outcomes,
          all in various forms so every learner can achieve success.

                Active learning is a teaching approach that engages students in
                the learning process through meaningful activities and critical
                thinking. As a TA, facilitating active learning will help
                students develop a deeper understanding of course content and
                build essential skills. Below are tips and examples to
                incorporate active learning into your teaching practices.

                  answer. Then, have them discuss with a partner before sharing

              <p className="mb-4">
                Direct Instruction (DI) is a teacher-led approach where the
                teacher controls the classroom activities and directs
                information to students in a structured and sequenced manner.
                There are various forms of DI, with some being more rigid than
                others. However, the Modern DI forms are much more effective,
                such as Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI), which is more
                flexible and involves eight didactic principles that enhance
                each other.

                <li>
                  <strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> Clearly defined goals
                  that students can understand. "By the end of this session, you
                  will be able toâ€¦."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Activating Prior Knowledge:</strong> Connecting new
                  information to what students already know. "What do you
                  already know about "x"? Where have you seen it being used
                  before?"
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Concept Development:</strong> Detailed explanation of
                  new concepts. How does this concept fit into the big picture
                  of what they are learning? For example, if functions and loops
                  are being taught, give a visual example of what it looks like
                  and what other contexts (areas or systems) where it can be
                  applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Skill Development:</strong> Demonstrating and
                  practicing new skills. Give a demonstration of the new skill.
                  Ensure that everyone can see what you are doing. You can also
                  record this so that students can refer back to it if they need
                  more support during the lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Guided Practice:</strong> Teacher-led practice
                  sessions. After the demonstration, take a problem and ask
                  students to suggest the next step. (Students can be in pairs
                  to discuss and suggest the next step to you). Question their
                  thinking along the way. Why do you think this is the step you
                  should take? Can anyone suggest another way?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Independent Practice:</strong> Students practice on
                  their own. Circulate around the room as students are working.
                  <strong> Pay attention </strong> to what is on their screens,
                  if you notice them making errors, ask them to pause and talk
                  through their choices. See if they can identify where they are
                  going wrong. If they can't, walk them back to where they
                  started making mistakes in their code or work, then provide
                  further guidance so they can achieve success. A good practice
                  is to have a digital resource bank on Brightspace, so they can
                  watch a tutorial on how to do "x" and then circle back to see
                  if they are on the right track after a few moments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lesson Closure:</strong> Assessing student
                  understanding through questions or small tasks. This can be
                  done by polls, small group discussion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lesson Importance:</strong> Explaining the relevance
                  of the lesson to students.

                <li>
                  <strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Research shows that EDI can be
                  more effective than exploratory methods, especially for weaker
                  students.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Equalizing Effect:</strong> EDI ensures all students
                  receive intentional instruction and opportunities to practice,
                  which can help bridge gaps in prior knowledge.
